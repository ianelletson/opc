At Optimized Constraints, we're dedicated to serving your software design and development needs while upholding our three pillars core values: integrity, collaboration, and results.

Optimized Constraints operates on the firm belief that we, as developers and consultants, serve people in every aspect of our work. No matter how close or far the end user is to the software in question, we strive to deliver value which respects their time and needs.

## History

I founded Optimized Constraints in 2021 following an equal-parts challenging and rewarding 7-year journey at [Protolabs](https://protolabs.com). There, I grew from a `C++` developer working on CAD/CAM software to the technical lead of the `.NET C#` team responsible for delivering the backbone of the highest grossing service line.
I saw through the successful launch of a global product with an international team working on a microservice based platform.
